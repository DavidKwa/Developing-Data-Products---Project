This app was developed for the Coursera Developing Data Products Course. It helps the user to calculate their estimated monthly fuel expenditure based on their typical monthly mileage travelled.

The user would also be required to input their fuel price per gallon in order to help calculate the estimated monthly fuel cost.

The user would also be able to apply several other filters to narrow down their search for the most fuel efficient vehicle based on the vehicle's other specifications like transmission type, horsepower, number of cylinders and engine displacement.
